## Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Overview

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn or not. The main goal was to analyze customer data, prepare it properly, and train a classification model to identify customers who are likely to leave.

Step-by-Step Explanation of What I Did
1. Imported Required Libraries

I started by importing necessary libraries such as:

Pandas and NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model

2. Loaded and Explored the Dataset

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Checked dataset shape and column details

Identified missing values and data types

Understood the target variable (Churn)

3. Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns (like customer ID if present)

Converted categorical columns into numerical format using encoding

Handled missing values if any

Prepared input features (X) and target variable (y)

4. Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into training and testing data

Used training data to train the model

Used testing data to evaluate performance

5. Model Building

Applied a classification algorithm

Trained the model using the training dataset

Generated predictions on the test dataset

6. Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using metrics like:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Analyzed how well the model predicts customer churn

# Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Categorical Encoding

Classification Modeling

Model Evaluation



# Conclusion

In this project, I implemented a complete customer churn prediction pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation. This project helped me understand how classification models work on real-world business problems.
